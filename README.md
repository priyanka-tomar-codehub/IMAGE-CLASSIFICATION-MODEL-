##Description of the Task: CNN for Image Classification on CIFAR-10 Dataset

The task presented here is the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The objective of this task is to train a deep learning model capable of recognizing and categorizing images into ten distinct classes, thereby demonstrating the power of CNNs in solving computer vision problems. This experiment covers all essential steps, including loading and preprocessing the dataset, constructing a CNN architecture, compiling and training the model, evaluating its performance, and analyzing the results.

Dataset Overview

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset in the machine learning and computer vision community. It consists of 60,000 color images (32×32 pixels each) belonging to 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The ten classes represent everyday objects and animals, specifically:

Airplane

Automobile

Bird

Cat

Deer

Dog

Frog

Horse

Ship

Truck

Because the dataset is relatively small in terms of image resolution yet diverse in terms of categories, it provides a suitable challenge for testing the performance of CNNs.

Preprocessing the Data

Before training the CNN, preprocessing is necessary to ensure efficient learning. The raw image pixel values in CIFAR-10 range from 0 to 255. To normalize the data, each pixel value was divided by 255.0, scaling them into the range [0,1]. This normalization step helps improve convergence during training by preventing large gradient values. The labels in CIFAR-10 are integers representing the classes, and they were flattened into 1D arrays to match the expected input format of the training function.

Building the CNN Model

The CNN architecture was designed using TensorFlow/Keras. CNNs are specialized neural networks for image processing, as they automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. The architecture consists of the following layers:

First Convolutional + MaxPooling Layer: A convolutional layer with 32 filters of size (3×3) and ReLU activation to extract low-level features such as edges and corners, followed by a 2×2 max pooling layer to reduce spatial dimensions.

Second Convolutional + MaxPooling Layer: A deeper convolutional layer with 64 filters to capture more complex features, again followed by a pooling layer.

Third Convolutional Layer: Another convolutional layer with 64 filters, which learns even higher-level patterns and textures.

Flatten Layer: Converts the 3D feature maps into a 1D vector, making the data suitable for fully connected layers.

Dense Layer: A fully connected layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation, which combines extracted features to learn non-linear decision boundaries.

Output Layer: A dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation, representing the probability distribution across the ten CIFAR-10 classes.

Model Compilation and Training

The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer, which is widely used due to its adaptive learning rate properties. The loss function selected was sparse categorical crossentropy, appropriate for multi-class classification with integer labels. Accuracy was chosen as the evaluation metric.

The model was trained for 10 epochs using the training set, with the testing set provided as validation data to monitor generalization performance. During training, the model learned to minimize the loss function and maximize classification accuracy by adjusting its internal weights.

Evaluation and Results

After training, the model was evaluated on the test set. The evaluation step computed the test loss and test accuracy, providing an unbiased estimate of how well the CNN generalizes to unseen data. The test accuracy achieved indicates the proportion of images correctly classified across the ten categories.

Conclusion

This task successfully demonstrated the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. By automatically extracting hierarchical features from raw images, the CNN achieved high accuracy compared to traditional machine learning models, which often rely on handcrafted features. The project highlights the strength of deep learning in handling image data and establishes CNNs as a powerful tool for solving real-world computer vision challenges. With further improvements such as data augmentation, dropout regularization, and deeper architectures, the performance could be enhanced even more.
